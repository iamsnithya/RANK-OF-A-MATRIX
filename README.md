# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Import the required library (numpy) in Python to perform matrix operations.
### Step 2: Define the matrix for which the rank is to be calculated.
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: Display the rank of the matrix as the output.
## Program:

    #Program to find the rank of a matrix.
    #Developed by: NITHYA S
    #RegisterNumber: 212224240106

    import numpy as np
    a=np.array([[3,2,5],[1,1,2],[3,3,6]])
    solution=np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
    print(solution)
    
## Output:
